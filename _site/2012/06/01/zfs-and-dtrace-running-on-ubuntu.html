<h2><span class="caps">ZFS</span> and DTrace running on Ubuntu Linux</h2>
<p class="meta"> 1 Jun 2012 &#8211; Jared Koumentis </p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ZFS</span> and DTrace</strong></p>
<p>These two technologies are the main thing I hear when I ask people &#8220;Why do you stay with a solaris-like operating system, instead of moving to Linux?&#8221; Hell, these two technologies were the reason why the company I work for spent several months building their own solaris-like distro based on the Illumos kernel.</p>
<p>Of course, I have my own opinions on these technologies. <span class="caps">ZFS</span> is certainly handy. Compared to other filesystem or filesystem management software, it does make things easy. For DTrace, I have an issue with the steep learning curve. The ability to instrument in real time with lowered probe effect is pretty cool though. Personally, I do not think that these two technologies are worth staying with or moving to a solaris-like OS. Primarily, this opinion comes down to community. You could pile all the communities together (Illumos, OpenIndiana, SmartOS, OmniOS) and you still wouldn&#8217;t approach the same level of community found in any of the major Linux distros. Need a distro designed to remove pain from the administration of your computers? Ubuntu. Need extensive documentation on everything you can imagine? Arch Linux. Need a great desktop distribution? Linux Mint. I could go on and on. Simply put, the community behind Linux is many times greater than that behind the solaris-like distros.</p>
<p>So, I had heard about <span class="caps">ZFS</span> and DTrace running on Linux. People have been working on them for years. Basically, since the time the technologies came out on Solaris. So, I decided to follow up on these ports and see what could be done. Luckily, I had great success in getting both to run on an Ubuntu server of mine. If you would like to do so as well, just follow the steps below.</p>
<h3>Firstly, <span class="caps">ZFS</span></h3>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Install an Ubuntu server. (I recommend trying it out on a VM first.)</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Attach 2 drives to use for testing <span class="caps">ZFS</span>. (Again, I was using a VM, so this was as simple as &#8220;attaching&#8221; two more virtual hard drives.)</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Partition the new drives. I used cfdisk on my two newly attached drives. If you aren&#8217;t sure of which /dev/sdx device the new drives attached as, just &#8220;cat /proc/partitions&#8221; and you should find it.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Do a &#8220;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade&#8221; to make sure your system is up to date.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Install the needed prerequisites with &#8220;sudo apt-get install python-software-properties bison flex build-essential libelf-dev zlib1g-dev libc6-dev-i386 libdwarf-dev binutils-dev&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Add the zfs-native apt repo with &#8220;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zfs-native/stable&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Update apt with the new sources from the zfs repo with &#8220;sudo apt-get update&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> Install ubuntu-zfs with &#8220;sudo apt-get install ubuntu-zfs&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>9)</strong> Create your new zpool with &#8220;sudo zpool create zfs-blog raidz /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1&#8221;. Here, &#8220;zpool create&#8221; is given the name for the pool &#8220;zfs-blog&#8221; and told to use &#8220;raidz&#8221; (which will mirror, in this example) and then told to use the two disks we attached and partitioned earlier &#8220;/dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> Check out your new zpool with &#8220;sudo zpool status&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>11)</strong> Check out your zfs-blog dataset with &#8220;sudo zfs list&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>12)</strong> See that it is listed with &#8220;df -h&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>13)</strong> Enjoy <span class="caps">ZFS</span> running on your Ubuntu server.</p>
<h3>Then, DTrace</h3>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Install git with &#8220;sudo apt-get install git&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Either make a git directory and move into it for you to keep your git stuff together or move to the directory you already use.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Clone my fork of the dtrace4linux repo with &#8220;git clone git://github.com/ShepBook/dtrace-for-linux.git&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Move into the dtrace-for-linux directory with &#8220;cd dtrace-for-linux&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Run &#8220;sudo make all&#8221; to build dtrace-for-linux.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> If you would like to install dtrace into /usr/sbin/dtrace (The solaris-style location for this tool) then do &#8220;sudo make install&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> To load the DTrace kernel module, do &#8220;sudo make load&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> Enjoy DTrace running on your Ubuntu server.</p>
<h3>Some side notes</h3>
<p>I used Ubuntu 12.04 <span class="caps">LTS</span> for this setup. I ran it in Virtualbox for Linux. I forked the &#8220;dtrace4linux&#8221; repo to make this easier and to be able to base my instructions on a set point in its development. I have been able to play around with <span class="caps">ZFS</span> and it seems fully functional. I am not well versed in DTrace, so I can&#8217;t really tell you how well it is or is not working. I was able to run some one liners just fine, however, I&#8217;m sure there are differences between the probes on Linux and the probes on a solaris-like system. If you were well versed in DTrace on solaris-like systems, then I expect that you will be able to work with and/or figure out how to make DTrace work on Linux just as well.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with the ability to run <span class="caps">ZFS</span> and DTrace on Ubuntu Linux, the people who have been holding back from moving to Linux from a solaris-like operating system can be convinced to join the wonderful community surrounding Linux. I, for one, welcome the solaris converts with open arms.</p>
