I came upon <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/docs/Horstmans_Laws.pdf" target="_blank">Horstman's Laws</a>. Certainly worth a read.

I was feeling artsy. This is what came out of it.

I think the Laws apply to more than just management though. I believe they apply to all aspects of business success or even, perhaps, all of life. I've added a few things not in Horstman's Laws but I feel they also apply.

So, what do you think? I hope you enjoyed.
