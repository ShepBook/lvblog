It's been in the making for months now, but the time has finally come! My Seeds article is up at Omniti.com/Seeds. In order to avoid having a mess of links cluttering the article, I've created this post for all the wonderful and useful links to information for your own further personal enlightenment. The links are generally clustered by author/speaker/topic. Enjoy!
